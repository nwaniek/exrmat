exrmat provides the Matlab function readexr, which is capable of reading
an RGB OpenEXR file, which is stored in HALF mode (see the OpenEXR
documentation for more information about this mode).

The function returns the three parts R, G, B in sRGB mode. Note that
OpenEXR is defined to store all data in linear RGB. Hence, if you want
to have linear RGB data loaded, simply change the function lin2srgb in
readexr.cpp
